Apache ODE Release Notes
========================

Apache ODE 1.3.7 includes about 48 bug fixes and improvements.

Apache ODE 1.3.7 requires Java 1.6.x or higher. The WAR distribution can 
run in most J2EE servlet containers. The JBI distribution should be able 
to run in any JBI container but has only been tested with ServiceMix 3.x
and latest ServiceMix 4.5.x (OSGi bundle) so far. See the BUILDING file if you 
want to build your own distribution from the source release. 

The most notable improvements:
  - Moved to minimum binary compatibility to JDK 6 from JDK 5.
  - ODE server with embedded Apache Tomee.
  - New ODE management console based on AngularJS.
  - Upgrade of Axis2, OpenJPA, Hibernate.
  - Moved to SLF4J logging with Log4j2 as the implementation.
  - There is database migration required from earlier versions.
  - Some major memory leaks have got fixed
